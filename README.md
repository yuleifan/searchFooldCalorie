# searchFooldCalorie
A full-stack demo for searching food calorie.

This is a simple full stack with server site and client site.

The server is a Restful API created using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB, so the MongoDB is needed to be installed locally, the API functions are: create one get all get many by name get one by id update one by id delete one by id, start the server by run command: npm run start.

The client is a front-end created using Vue3 and Vite, the simple interface just contains search food by name and showing the result with a total calorie sum, start the interface by run command: npm run dev.
